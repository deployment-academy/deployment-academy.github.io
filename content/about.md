Deployment is a tech blog focused on software engineering, DevOps and Cloud Security. The content that you would expect to see here goes from beginners and foundational level to some more advanced and practical aspects. 

Most of the time you'll see hands-on tutorials with pointers to external documentation but you may also expect to see some careers tips and eventually an opinion article.

The goal is to provide content that can help engineers to build more secure and resilient systems.
