Deployment is a blog focused on software development, security, and operations. The main goal of this blog is to share some things I'm working on or researching to solve real problems; often (but not always), it's the compilation of notes taken during a spike or PoC.

### About Me

I'm a software engineer with experience in enterprise software development and distributed systems, currently focused on solving security problems. Probably the best way to get in touch is on [X](https://x.com/soeirosantos_).
