Deployment is a tech blog focused on Software Engineering and DevSecOps.

You should expect to see here content related to things I'm currently using or researching to solve real problems. You may also find foundational and introductory-level content, which I have been hoping to find more time to produce.

The best way to contact me and/or provide feedback is via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/soeiro_santos).
