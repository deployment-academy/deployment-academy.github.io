Deployment is a tech blog focused on DevSecOps.

You should expect to see here content related to things I'm currently using or researching to solve real problems. You may also find foundational and introductory-level content, which I have been hoping to find more time to create.

### Author

My name is Romulo Santos. I'm a software engineer with experience in enterprise software development and distributed systems. More recently, I have been working with platform teams trying to find out a way to streamline the product engineering flow, while being more interested in the security problems.
