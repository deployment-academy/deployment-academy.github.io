IaC tools allow teams to define their infrastructure in a reproducible-automated fashion, increasing speed and consistency while preventing errors, misconfiguration, and configuration drifts. IaC also plays an important role in security. It gives visibility over the whole infrastructure, including its security aspects and components, even before they have been deployed. Development and/or security and operations teams can define sensible security defaults and a security baseline enforcing best practices that are automated and applied via the CICD pipeline, where changes can be reviewed and approved following the separation of duties principle.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
