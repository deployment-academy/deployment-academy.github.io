thought I&amp;rsquo;d take some time to organize my notes and share it here. This is a long tutorial because I&amp;rsquo;ll drop here all
the experimentation process, but I hope the separation of the sections can help anyone who lands here looking for
specific insights in some parts of the setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this tutorial, we are going to spin up a CockroachDB secure cluster running in Kubernetes with certificates managed by
HashiCorp Vault and issued by cert-manager. Before we get to the final state, we are going to evolve the installation
step by step to understand how each component is contributing to the setup and what we are gaining.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll focus on the execution, assuming you are minimally familiar with these components. Links will be provided for
additional context when necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This tutorial can be executed from your local machine, no cloud resources are necessary.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
